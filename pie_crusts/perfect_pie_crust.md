Makes enough dough for two crusts.

__Ingredients__

Dry:
* 2 ¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
* 2 sticks of unsalted butter—right out of the refrigerator and cut into small cubes: length-wise, lengthwise, the other way, then cut down the middle.
* 2 oz cream cheese—cut into small pieces. (This ingredient is inevitably sticky, so don’t worry if you have to pull apart * little gobs to get it into small pieces.)
* 3 Tablespoons sugar—I like white sugar for fruit pies or brown sugar for winter pies, but both are lovely.
* 1 tsp salt

Wet:
* ¼ cup + 1 Tablespoon frozen vodka* taken right out the freezer
* ¼ cup + 1 Tablespoon cold tap water, combined with above vodka (Keep vodka handy to add more as needed)

__Directions__

1. Combine the dry ingredients in a food processor and pulse until thoroughly combined.
2. Incorporate the cream cheese to the flour mixture, pulsing 5–6 times until the cream cheese is incorporated.
3. Add the butter to the mixture, pulsing 10–12 times until no big chunks remain, and the mixture readily sticks together between your fingers.
4. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and fold in the cold vodka and ice water. If it is still dry, keep adding vodka—it burns off during the cooking process, so you really can’t add too much!
5. Separate the dough into two discs and wrap them tightly in plastic, press them down into flat circles (this saves tons of time when rolling them out) and chill for about a half hour.  The dough will be STICKY—but part of its indestructibility is its capacity to take more flour.  Start with a generous 1/3 cup of flour when rolling it out and go from there!
