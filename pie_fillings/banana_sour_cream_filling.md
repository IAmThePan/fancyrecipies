Banana Sour Cream Pie Filling
=============================

I find this pie is best with a [Graham Cracker Crust](/pie_crusts/graham_cracker_crust.md).

__Ingredients__

* 12 oz softened cream cheese (1/3rd fat OK)
* 1/2 cups sour cream
* 1/4 cups honey
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 large, ripe, mashed banana
* 2 Tbsp fresh lemon or lime juice

__Directions__

1. Beat together all ingredients until well-blended.
2. Pour into cooled pie crust.
3. Chill at least 3 hours.
4. Optionally top with sliced bananans before serving.
