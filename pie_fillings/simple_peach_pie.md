Simple Peach Pie
================

I usually make this pie with the [Simple Oil Crust](../pie_crusts/simple_oil_crust.md) but only because I am lazy.
This pie requires two crusts.

__Ingredients__

* 8 peaches
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* 1/2 cups sugar
* 1/4 Tbsp flour
* 2 Tbsp tapioca
* 1 Tbsp butter

__Directions__

1. Peal peaches, cut into 12ths, and place in a bowl. If peaches are difficult to peal you can boil them in water for 1 minute to make things easier.
2. Add tapioca, sugar, flour, and salt to the peaches.
3. Add mixture to a shallow pie dish and dot with butter.
4. Add the lattice crust to the top and sprinkle sugar onto the crust for browning.
5. Bake:
   15 minutes at 450°F.
   60 minutes at 350°F or until crust is golden brown.
