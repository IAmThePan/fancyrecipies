Strawberry Rhubarb Pie
======================

I usually make this pie with the [Simple Oil Crust](../pie_crusts/simple_oil_crust.md).
This pie requires two crusts.

__Ingredients__

* 5 stalks Rhubarb
* 3 quarts Strawberries
* 1/3 cups sugar
* 3 Tbsp tapioca
* 1 Tbsp flour
* 1 Tbsp butter

__Directions__

1. Slice rhubarb into small pieces and place into a bowl.
2. Remove tops and slice strawberries into a different bowl.  You should have twice the volume of strawberries as rhubarb.
3. Combine fruit. Add tapioca, sugar, flour.
4. Add mixture to a pie dish and dot with butter.
5. Add the lattice crust to the top and sprinkle sugar onto the crust for browning.  Alternatively, use an egg wash.
5. Bake:
   60 minutes at 375Â°F or until crust is golden brown.
