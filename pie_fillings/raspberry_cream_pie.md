Raspberry Cream Pie
=======================

Adapted from Marth Stewart's Raspberry Cream Pie [recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20210203181038/https://www.marthastewart.com/1078511/raspberry-cream-pie)

I usually make this pie with the [xxx](../pie_crusts/simple_oil_crust.md).

__Ingredients__

* 4 large egg yolks
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt
* 2 3/4 cups whole milk
* 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces
* 3 cups raspberries (about 12 ounces)

__Directions__

1. Whisk yolks in a heatproof bowl.
2. Whisk together granulated sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium saucepan; whisk in milk and vanilla seeds and pod. Bring to a boil, whisking; cook, still whisking, 2 minutes more.
3. Pour milk mixture into yolks in a slow, steady stream, whisking until combined. Return mixture to saucepan; return to a boil, whisking. Remove from heat.
4. Add crushed raspberries and butter. Mix until homogeneous and the butter is melted.
5. Pass through a sieve into another bowl. Let custard cool, whisking occasionally, about 10 minutes.
6. Pour custard into cooled crust. Add whole berries into the filled pie, if desired. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.
