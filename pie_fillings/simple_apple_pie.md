Simple Apple Pie
================

I usually make this pie with the [Simple Oil Crust](../pie_crusts/simple_oil_crust.md) but only because I am lazy.
I should make it with [Flaky Butter Crust](../pie_crusts/flaky_butter_crust.md).
This pie requires two crusts.

__Ingredients__

* 10 Granny Smith apples
* 2 pears (optional)
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* 1/2 cups sugar
* 1/4 Tbsp flour
* 2 Tbsp tapioca
* 1 Tbsp butter
* 2 tsp cinnamon

__Directions__

1. Skin, core and slice apples (and pears) into 12ths.
2. Place apples in a colander and add lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar.  Let apples drain for an hour.  Collect drained juices in a bowl.
3. In a separate bowl combine flour, tapioca, and the rest of the sugar (1/4 cup).
4. After apples have drained, mix apples with dry ingredients.
5. Place apple slices into a pie dish.  Pour in the collected juices.  Dot with butter.  Sprinkle with cinnamon.  Cover with second crust and sprinkle sugar onto the crust for browning.
6. Bake:
   60 minutes at 350Â°F.
