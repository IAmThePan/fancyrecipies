Simple Apple Pie
================

I usually make this pie with the [Simple Oil Crust](../pie_crusts/simple_oil_crust.md) but only because I am lazy.
I should make it with [Flaky Butter Crust](../pie_crusts/flaky_butter_crust.md).

__Ingredients__

* 10 Granny Smith apples
* 2 pears (optional)
* 2-4 Tbsp flour
* 2 Tbsp tapioca
* 1/2 cups sugar
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* 1 Tbsp butter

__Directions__

1. Peal and slice the apples and pears and place in a strainer inside a bowl to catch the juice.
2. Add 3 Tbsp sugar and the lemon juice.
3. Let sit for an hour.
3. Mix in the flour, tapioca and the rest of the sugar.
4. Pour into a pie shell and dot with butter.
5. Bake:
   60 minutes at 350Â°F.
